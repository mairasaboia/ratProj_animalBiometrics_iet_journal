\section{Related work}

\subsection{Animal Behavior Analysis}
We should first describe previous work on animal behavior analysis, discuss the differences between our work with previous work, and at last we can say we focus on animal biometrics and re-identification problems to solve animal behavior analysis problem.

\subsection{Animal Biometrics}


In this section we can present an overview of recent works in animal biometrics and compare their scenery / challenges / advantages, and explain whether their solution is applicable or not to our project.
For example: some animals have color patterns or they are not deformable.

\subsection{Re-identification}

We should describe applications where re-identification is important and which type of information (Shape / feature /  color or any other descriptor) is used.

\subsection{Deep Learning/ Siamese Networks}
 (Yifang: This is one solution for Re-indentification problem, can we put this part in Re-identification section?)   \cite{zagoruyko2015learning}
	Describe the Siamese Net in the context of patch matching and person re-identification

\section{Enunciations}
%%%% Most of the enunciations like theorem, lemma, corollary, proposition, defintion,
%%%% condition, example, conjecture etc. are defined in the class file.

%%%% If the author wants to add or modify the enunciation style

\begin{theorem}\label{T0.1}
Assume that $\alpha>0, \gamma>1, \beta>\frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1}$.
Then there exists a small $\tau_1>0$, such that for $\tau\in
[0,\tau_1)$, if $c$ crosses $c(\tau)$ from the direction of
to  a small amplitude periodic traveling wave solution of
(2.1), and the period of $(\check{u}^p(s),\check{w}^p(s))$ is
\[
\check{T}(c)=c\cdot \left[\frac{2\pi}{\omega(\tau)}+O(c-c(\tau))\right].

\section{Figures \& Tables}

The output for figure is:

\begin{figure}[!h]
%\centering\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figurename.eps}
%%%call your figure name in the place "figurename.eps"
\caption{Insert figure caption here}
\label{fig_sim}
\end{figure}

 An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
 (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
 The subfigure \verb+\label+ commands are set within each subfloat command, the
 \verb+\label+ for the overall figure must come after \verb+\caption+.
 \verb+\hfil+ must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
 The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \verb+\subfigure+ is
 used instead of \verb+\subfloat+.

%\begin{figure*}[!h]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figurename.eps}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figurename.eps}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
